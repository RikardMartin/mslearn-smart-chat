For .NET and Java applications, modernization is the most common approach, however, sometimes a migration is still necessary. When you modernize an application, you use additional cloud provider services to optimize the cost, reliability, and performance. Your application can take advantage of PaaS products such as Azure App Service, Azure SQL Database Managed Instance, and containers. Azure API Management is a hybrid, multicloud management platform for APIs hosted in Azure, third-party clouds, and on-premises environments. Azure API Management includes an API gateway component, which serves as an entry point for all incoming requests and forwards them to respective backend services. The API gateway allows API providers to abstract API implementations and modify backend components without impacting API consumers. It also helps enhance security of these components through policies that provide support for such features as authentication and authorization, quotas and rate limiting, restricting callers based on the originating IP address, as well as rewriting of HTTP headers and URLs.
